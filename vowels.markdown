Notes:
	There is no short counterpart of æ or long counterpart of ǫ. Both
	sounds existed at one time, but in the kind of Old Norse on which the
	normalised spelling is based short æ had coalesced with e and ǭ with
	á. The use of œ to denote the long equivalent of ø is an arbitrary
	convention, and in some works ǿ is found.


	Most of these sixteen distinctive vowels occur exclusively in stressed
	syllables. In unstressed syllables there is no distinction of length and
	for the most part a basic three-way contrast is found between a, i and
	u. Some uncertainty exists about how these unstressed vowels were
	pronounced, but the student will be safe enough using the following.

Unstressed vowels:

	The symbol below the i, looks like a captal T, it
        is the lowering diacritic, indicating that the sound
        is a true mid-vowel, or more opened than without the 
        diacritic.

a /a/  as stressed a          leysa ‘[to] release’

i /̞i/  as in English city     máni ‘moon’

u /ʊ/  as in English wood     eyru ‘ears’


Dipthongs:

	The inverted breve underneath a vowel in IPA
        indicates that it is not syllabic.

au  /a̯u/		as in English now	lauss 'loose'  
ei  /3̯i/		as in English bay	bein  'bone'  
ey  /ø̯y/, /3̯y/ 		ON e + y          	hey   'hay'  
    (The second pronounciation is for a later period than the first.)
