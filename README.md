Living Old Norse!
================

I have begun the project of teaching myself Reconstructed Old Norse. Of course,
learning a language is a lot easier if there is a community of speakers. But
Old Norse is a dead language! So if I want a community of speakers to connect
with, it is naturally going to be people interested in bringing back the dead.

I searched for an existing community like this, but I didn't find any that were
exactly this sort of project, with any centralized organization or hub, that
facilitates collaboration the way github does. So I decided just to create one.

It is also, for now, a logical place to store any new experimental software I
create which facilitates those learning this particular variety of Old Norse.

This project is using Classical/Reconstructed Pronounciation as opposed to
the modern Icelandic one.

In my experience with language acquisition, I have found it can be helpful to
have a live chatroom. To that effect, I suggest #OldNorseHub on Freenode.

Since, I want, to some extent, to revive the language, I propose perhaps
marking newly coined terms with an unused symbol, so that we can use them with
eachother and still recognize that they are not authentic Old Norse. Perhaps we
can steal vocabulary from modern Icelandic, and mark such 'stolen' words.  For
example, appending 'I' to the end of back ported modern Icelandic terms.

There is no short counterpart of æ or long counterpart of ǫ. Both
sounds existed at one time, but in the kind of Old Norse on which the
normalised spelling is based short æ had coalesced with e and ǭ with
á. The use of œ to denote the long equivalent of ø is an arbitrary
convention, and in some works ǿ is found.

Most of these sixteen distinctive vowels occur exclusively in stressed
syllables. In unstressed syllables there is no distinction of length and
for the most part a basic three-way contrast is found between a, i and
u. Some uncertainty exists about how these unstressed vowels were
pronounced, but the student will be safe enough using the following.

Unstressed vowels:

        The symbol below the IPA for i, looks like a captal T, it is the
        lowering diacritic, indicating that the sound is a true mid-vowel, or
        more opened than without the diacritic.

Vowel | IPA  | Description                     | Example word       
----- | ---- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ 
    a | /a/  | as stressed a                   | leysa ‘[to] release’
    i | /̞i/  | as in English city              | máni ‘moon’
    u | /ʊ/  | as in English wood              | eyru ‘ears’


Dipthongs:

        Notes:

        The inverted breve underneath a vowel in IPA
        indicates that it is not syllabic. Each dipthong
        is only one syllable.
        
        The second pronounciation for ey is for a later period than the first.

        I am having an issue where the diacritic shows up on the first letter
        on the web, but on the second one in my source. I intend it to be on
        the second letter.
