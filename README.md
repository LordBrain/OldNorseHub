Old Norse HUB
=============

I have begun the project of teaching myself Reconstructed Old Norse.

This repository, is where I store various notes, links to resources or tools which I found particularly helpful.

It is also, for now, a logical place to store any new experimental software I
create which facilitates those learning this particular variety of Old Norse.

It is also, I hope the beginning of a potential hub, for students of Reconstructed Old Norse, seeking others with
whom to communicate and so revive this language.

This project is using Classical/Reconstructed Pronounciation as opposed to
the modern Icelandic one.

Eventually, we may even find a way to extend the language, perhaps marking
newly coined terms with an unused symbol, so that we can use them with
eachother and still recognize that they are not authentic Old Norse. Perhaps we
can steal vocabulary from modern Icelandic, and mark such 'stolen' words.  For
example, appending a C for a word coined by this community, and an M for a
back ported modern Icelandic term.
